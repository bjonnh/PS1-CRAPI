PS1-CRAPI : Pumping Station One - Control Relay API

This is a simple Authorization server created initially for the
Pumping Station One hackerspace (http://www.pumpingstationone.org).

It is meant to serve as an interface between physical modules
connected to machinery that requires users to be certified and a
server that handles user rights (LDAP?).

Documentation about the Auth System Python API can be found in:
docs/Auth_Module_Python_API.txt

Documentation about the HTTP API can be found in:
docs/HTTP_API.txt

It has been written and tested using Python > 3.4 feel free to make it
Python 2.x compatible if you are brave enough.

To run the tests, use "nosetest".

The test_async is the only source for a working example feel free to
mess with it.
